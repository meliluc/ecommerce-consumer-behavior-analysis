# 📦 Ecommerce Consumer Behavior Analysis

Final project for the Data Analytics course (CoderHouse), focused on analyzing consumer loyalty and digital interaction in e-commerce using Power BI.

## 📊 Project Summary

This project explores:
- Demographic segmentation of customers
- Patterns of purchase behavior across loyalty levels
- Weekday trends, channel and payment preferences
- Digital interaction: ads engagement, social media influence, research time

It was built with a fully normalized dataset in Excel, custom KPIs using DAX, and a dashboard structured for business storytelling.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI** (interactive dashboard, custom DAX measures, slicers, bookmarks)
- **Excel** (normalized relational dataset, dimension/fact model)
- **SQL & DAX** (aggregations, KPIs, time intelligence, logic)
